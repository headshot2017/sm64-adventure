# sm64-adventure - Super Mario 64 in Sonic Adventure

Mod for Sonic Adventure DX that uses [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64) to insert Mario from Super Mario 64 into the game.

In early development.

NOTE: Unlike other SADX mods, this uses MinGW's GCC compiler instead of Visual Studio's MSVC.
